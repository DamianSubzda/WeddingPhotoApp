# WeddingPhotoApp

## üìã Description

WeddingPhotoApp is a client-server web application designed for uploading and sharing photos in a public gallery. Guests at a wedding can upload their photos to the gallery, which can then be viewed by all participants. Users can upload, rotate, and caption their photos. The application features pagination, loading the 10 most recent photos at a time, with additional photos being loaded dynamically as the user scrolls.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Photo Upload**: Users can upload photos to a public gallery.
- **Photo Manipulation**: Users can rotate photos and add captions before uploading.
- **Public Gallery**: Photos are available for viewing by all wedding participants.
- **Pagination**: The gallery uses pagination to load the 10 latest photos first. Additional photos are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls through the gallery.
- **Local File Storage**: Uploaded photos are saved locally on the server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core**: Backend API built on .NET Core.
- **React**: Frontend developed using React for a dynamic user interface.
- **Entity Framework (EF)**: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing metadata about uploaded photos.
- **Unit Testing**: Tests are written using MSTest.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and testing interface.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern, separating responsibilities into distinct layers for maintainability and scalability:

- **Repository Layer**: Handles database interactions through Entity Framework.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used to transfer data between the backend and frontend.
- **Models**: Represent the data structures in the application.
- **Services**: Contain business logic.
- **Controllers**: Manage API requests and handle communication between the frontend and backend.
